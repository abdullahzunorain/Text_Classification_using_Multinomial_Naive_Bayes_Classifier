# Binary Text Classification using Python

This project focuses on binary text classification, aiming to accurately categorize textual data into one of two predefined classes. Leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming text data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Implementation of various machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for binary classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive analysis using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of results for clear and concise insights.
